<p>One bug is fixed, but another bug is introduced. It&#39;s called regression &quot;whack-a-mole&quot;, and when your projects become complex, it can suck your team into endless cycles of revisions.</p>
<p>Using Travis, Circle CI, Probo we can set up an easy to use and fast testing pathway to ensure your most critical features deliver consistent business value and your code does not introduce visual regressions from build to build on important browsers and devices.</p>
